# Interface.js
 A visual html interface for js applications!
 <br><br>
 Includes a couple fonts and is based off Materialize, but does not use it.
 <br><br>
 More info will be added here later; for now, make sure to link interface.css and interface.js in interface.
 <br>
 Look at the example in index.html and example/js/exampleSite.js for how to instantiate an interface.
